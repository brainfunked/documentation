= Tendrl Architectural Guidelines

:toc:

== Goals

* Tendrl is a framework that provides services to Storage Systems. It enables
  and/or enhances the manageability of these systems.
* Through the implementation of the core framework and the supporting services,
  Tendrl provides an interface for the administrator to know the state of the
  Storage Systems being managed and to perform operations on the
  various components.
* The interface presented to the administrator is performant enough to enable
  dynamic updates to the displayed information at load.
* The interface presented to the administrator is responsive enough to enable
  lag-free interactions.
* The interface should convey the state of the Storage Systems using
  System-specific terms and representations.
* Tendrl, as a framework, is generic and abstract to facilitate a low
  entry barrier for different types of Storage Systems to plug into Tendrl to
  leverage its services.
* Tendrl and the Storage Systems communicate with an abstract glue layer, with
  a well defined interface, which precludes any direct, dependent coupling
  between the two.
* Tendrl can be deployed, updated and it’s lifecycle can be managed independent
  of the Storage Systems.
* Tendrl can be deployed in a High Availability configuration.


== Assumptions

* Tendrl does not need to be a real-time system.
* Tendrl's (public) interface is not expected to be loaded with hundreds of operational
  queries per minute, given the nature of the Systems it represents.
* In a deployed environment, it is easier to update configuration rather than
  code.
* Systems and processes can and will fail. Each component must be monitored
  and every system interaction must allow for fall-backs.


== Architectural Guidelines

The guidelines exist to ensure that the Tendrl project as a whole always has a
singular technical vision and the corresponding direction for the
implementation. These guidelines could, and should, evolve over time; depending
upon the direction Tendrl takes as a project.


=== The Storage Systems leverage Tendrl.

Tendrl needs to be viewed as a framework which provides services to Storage
Systems. In this domain, the Storage Systems would choose to consume and/or build-upon one or
more of the services provided by Tendrl. Neither the Storage Systems or Tendrl
need to have an explicit dependency upon each other for their core operations.


=== Changes in the implementation of one of the connected Systems does not affect the other.

Tendrl and the Storage Systems should be decoupled to an extent that both are
free to evolve without having to worry about breaking or impacting each other's
implementation.


=== A well defined Glue Layer is the integration point that enables decoupled Systems to connect.

Building on the above points, an abstraction is necessary to ensure that the
Storage System and Tendrl can communicate with each other. A Glue Layer enables
this.

The Glue Layer is a well defined interface which both Systems can adhere to. So
long as this interface is stable, neither of the Systems would be impacted by
the changes in the implementation of the other.


=== Tendrl shouldn’t assume that the Storage Systems could fit into a generic storage model.

It is logical to try and develop a generic storage model for different systems
to fit into. This facilitates the development of the codebase to be modular,
based around the abstractions of the generic model.

However, given the diverse nature of the Storage Systems that may wish to
leverage Tendrl, the generic model that relies upon the existence of specific
storage domain entities would impose limitations eventually. Specific
exceptions would eventually creep up that compromise the generic nature of such
a storage model.


=== The Glue Layer is defined in the most abstract of models--by representing System components in an Object Model.

The Object Model is largely based upon the Object Oriented paradigm. The
generic storage model can be abstracted further to be composed based on
hierarchical Objects. These Objects have metadata that describes the..
* States
* Attributes
* Relationships
* Actions
..of the Objects, among other things.

A rich framework that allows for extensible metadata to be associated with the
Objects allows for the potential accommodation of diverse Storage Systems,
without sacrificing the generic nature of Tendrl.


=== Tendrl doesn’t need to understand Storage System specific information, but needs merely to be able to display it to allow the Administrator to understand and act upon it.

The Object Model is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate current and future metadata
to describe the Objects. This metadata can be used to display the information
to the Administrator that makes it legible and allows the Administrator to take
informed decisions and to initiate the correct Actions with the appropriate
Parameters. In addition, with the provisions in the metadata, it would be
possible to convey the information in a `language’ (not to be confused with the
spoken languages) that is specific to the Storage System.

Automated actions could also be described as part of the Object metadata. This
would allow Tendrl to respond to Events or changes in the Object States,
without the explicit involvement of the Administrator, unless specifically
required.

In any of these cases, Tendrl does not need to understand what a particular
state or action represents -- it requires to know how to convey the
information to the administrator, gather and provide the appropriate parameters
and actions to the Storage System on behalf of the Administrator, and/or take
appropriate actions upon the Objects, as prescribed by the Object metadata.

This also has a side effect that narrows down the scope of Tendrl’s Core.
Instead of trying to keep up with the specifics of various Storage Systems (and
the potentially perpetual exercise of fitting new Systems into a generic
model), Tendrl Core can focus on building a rich Object Model.


=== State is stored and updated centrally (as a representation of the Object Model) by the Storage Systems in a Central Store and Tendrl only reads it.

The core functionality of Tendrl is to show the current, accurate State of the
Storage System to the Administrator. All the interactions are governed by the
current State of the various Objects. The States are Object specific--defined
by the metadata.

Any Object described using the Model has an entity that understands it’s State.
For example, in most cases, the Storage System would be aware of the States of
the Objects such as a Cluster, Clustered Volumes, Logical Volumes etc., while
the monitoring system would be aware of the state of physical entities such as
Hard Drives, Nodes etc. The best way to ensure that the State is represented
correctly is to ensure that the system responsible for understanding the State
is the one that keeps it updated.


=== Actions, their parameters, queries etc. from the Administrator or Tendrl (in automation cases) are also represented as separate Objects associated with one or more Objects that constitute the State of the Storage System.

Representing the actions, queries etc. as Objects allows for centralised
maintenance of all the interactions in Tendrl. The Storage Systems monitor
these Objects and take the necessary actions. The results of these actions are
also stored as sub-Objects under the hierarchy of the original Action Object.


=== Tendrl core should focus on creating a rock-solid communication layer that ties itself, the Central Store and the Storage Systems together.

Given the distributed nature of a Tendrl deployment, the stability and
reliability of the communication layer forms a central concern to be addressed.

Along with the development of the Object Model, Tendrl Core’s focus needs also
to be placed upon ensuring reliability for the maintenance of the
representation of the said Model.


=== Central Store for the State with a proper support for persistence, clustering, client side locking and access control enables a distributed, stateless, scalable and highly available system.

With correctly implemented locking and access control policies in the Central
Store, it is possible to build a distributed system that relies on cheap copies
of Tendrl Core that can be brought up or teared down to scale based on the
requirements.

This enables various deployment scenarios such as Containerization, High
Availability and Redundant configurations.

All of this relies upon the Central Store itself being clustered and highly
available.


=== The Central Store enables journaling as all interactions between Tendrl and the Storage Systems are represented as persistent Objects before their invocation.

Tracking the Actions as Objects in a persistent Store enables journaling as
these Objects are ensured to have persisted before the actual Actions are
invoked. Coupling the journaling with client side locking allows for a
distributed, redundant deployment of Translators that can carry out the
operations on the Storage Systems.


=== Translators are agents deployed close to the Storage Systems, that translate the State of the Storage Systems into the Object Model and the Actions from Tendrl in the form of the Object Model into invocations upon the Storage System.

The Translators would be maintained by the developers of the Storage System.
They should be as closely coupled with the Storage System as possible to ensure
the most efficient and resilient communication path between the Central Store
and the Storage System.

By implementing locking, multiple copies of the Translators can be deployed
that would ensure: Distribution of the Action invocations across multiple
Translators Redundancy in the invocation of the  Actions by enabling handover
to a different Translator should one fail.

The Translators could also be implemented to ensure duplex or simplex
communication between the Central Store and the Storage System.
